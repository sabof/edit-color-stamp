;; The latest version, and all the relevant information can be found there.
;;
;; You should find a qt_color_picker folder in the same directory as this file.
;; If you want to use the QT color picker, go to that folder and run:

;; $ qmake qt_color_picker.pro; make

;; then move the qt_color_picker executable somewhere in your path, or point the
;; ecs-qt-picker-exec variable to it's location.
